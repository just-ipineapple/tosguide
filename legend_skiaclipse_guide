=== B. Battle Phase

=============================================

=============================================
== B.a Phase 0 - Shadowmancer's Room 
=============================================

Once you have entered the red portal, additional entry is forbidden for party members.
You cannot enter the raid again if you disconnect, get VGA-error, or die and leave map. 

=============================================
== B.b Phase 1 - Chained Skiaclipse 
=============================================

Skiaclipse is located in the middle of the map. Saviours spawn South.
Skiaclipse cannot move, and the side towards North is always the back-side of Skiaclipse


=#= Skill :
-- Light Pillar
> 5 light pillars follow players to deal high multi-hit damage.

-- Falling Stones (Inflict Stack)
> Stones drop in random locations.
> Everyhit, inflict +1 stack (can't be removed).
> Avoid getting 100 stack debuff from hit by Falling Stones and Rock Wave.

-- Rock Wave(Inflict Stack)
> Stones rise from the ground, and shoot outward.
> Everyhit, inflict +1 stack (can't be removed).
> Avoid this skill by stay close to the Skiaclipse.

=#= Gimmick :
-- Rampage - Phase 1
if any player reaches 100 stacks individually,
the Skiaclipse will deal 10-20% max HP damage to all players every 3 seconds until you fail the raid.

-- Summon invincible healing mobs 
> Skiaclipse summons 10 mobs, at: 70%, 40%, and 10% HP.
> When mobs are alive, the Skiaclipse gains a buff to reduce all incoming damage by 90%, for 3 minutes.
> Mobs are summoned in 1 random location, then they move towards the Skiaclipse.
> Mobs never spawn twice in the same location.
> When mobs get near the Skiaclipse, each mob heals the Skiaclipse for 1% HP/s.

> Mobs inflict a 10 seconds armour break (can't be removed).
> Drop mob HP to 20%, Nuke together using all strongest AoE skill.
> Avoid on hit mobs separately, desync on mobs HP make it more difficult to wipeout the mobs at the same time.

=============================================
== B.c Phase 2 - Final Skiaclipse
=============================================

At 5% HP, Skiaclipse automatically enters Phase 2.
Immediately, a meteor drops on you. Most players get wiped right there.

DEF: 50'000+
MDEF: 25'000+
Healing: 3000+

=============================================

=== F. Class Roles

=============================================

=#= Class Roles
-- Healer
> Requires the highest DEF & MDEF, high HP, and best play.
> Priest revive must be saved for bone prison.
> Keep healing the player who is trapped inside the bone prison.
> Healers must remember all % thresholds and prepare in advance to burst heal the affected player if needed.
> Healer must remember who has been resurrected already. Do not waste resurrect cooldown.
> Oracles, please use counterspell to destroy orb-light-puddles, and counterspell to destroy tornado.
> Use fade on party to prevent skiaclipse dive attack after thunder.
> Oracle twist of fate is useful for phase 1 near 5% HP, and at phase 2 near 2% HP.

-- Aggro or Tank
> Requires sufficient DPS to keep aggro.
> Once phase 2 starts, immediately lure skiaclipse away from the middle.
> The boss will almost never use thunder or smoke blast on tank.
> Stand next to the wall, and make skiaclipse face you.
> Be careful of the gimmick portals opening. You might accidentally enter the gimmick room and lure skiaclipse to that room.
> You are the one to decide your battle location. You must look for a safe spot with less puddles & clouds.
> Keep an eye on your party members. Skiaclipse might have spawned clouds & puddles on them. They cannot stay and fight. You must move immediately.
> You must not move towards your party to take curse, because skiaclipse will claw-attack in their direction. Let the player with invincibility skills take curse instead.

-- DPS & Utility
> If you have a tank or aggro player, you must stay away from boss claw attacks. 
> Stay behind the boss and watch for smoke blast, thunder, and dive.
> Use your invincibility skills if you think you cannot run away in time.
> Builds with featherfoot (levitation) are immune to claw, and immune to dive.
> Call PASS if you have a chrono
> At least 1 wizard must have max magic shield to reduce damage from true damage attacks. Turn on Party share attribute.
> Decide before raid what you will do when orbs spawn. Lure orb or kill orb?
> Some builds have a very easy time destroying puddles (cannoneer, oracle, sapper).
> Does your build have invincibility skills? Then take curse from player without invincibility skills.
> DPS is responsible for killing the bone prison as fast as possible.
> Using invincible skill like chrono stop near %HP thresholds makes boss never use curse or bone prison on you.

-- Gimmick
> The gimmick clear grants +100% damage and +100% healing buff for 30 seconds to all players.
> Gimmick requires 1 player each time.
> Raid is very possible even without gimmick.
